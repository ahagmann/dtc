Digital Design Timing Constraints

Generate and visualize timing constraints for digital source synchronous interfaces.
Specify setup and hold times and get input and output delay constraints.

# Usage

* Open source_synchronous_constraints.ipynb
* adapt clock period, setup and hold times
* run all cells
